# It's the Final Countdown React Timer
I needed a countdown timer in my punions client and this is a project showing how to create one.

# What it does
I have a custom hook called Timer.js with which you can start a countdown timer in seconds. I am also able to change the color of the timer, if you have 45 seconds remaining and then a different color when you have 15 seconds remaining. 

It gives you the ability to start, pause, and reset the countdown timer.
